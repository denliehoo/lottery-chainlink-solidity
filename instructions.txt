1. truffle unbox smartcontractkit/box
-> gives boiler plate code such as: 
    -> e.g. PriceConsumerV3 for data feeds
    -> MyContract for API Calls
    -> RandomNumberConsumer for random number generator
    -> migrations folders, scripts, testing, etc...
-> create a .env file (see .env.example) and place the env variable such a mnemoic (the seed phrase e.g. cat dog runâ€¦.) and the RPC url
    -> if dont have a mnemoic: npx mnemonics to get the seed phrase
    -> Get the RPC url from infura/speedynodes/moralis/etc [Note: best to use infura wss:// RPC urls]
    -> place the seedphrase and rpc url in the .env file. 
    -> Remember to put that file in .gitignore 
    e.g. in .env file
    MNEMONIC="cat dog ....."
    RPC_URL="wss://kovan.infura.io/ws/v3/123abc......"

2. npm install   // install all dependencies e.g. @truffle/hdwallet-provider, dotenv ,...
3. Delete the unnecessary boiler plate code and start coding....
4. truffle console --network kovan   //(or whatever network)
    await web3.eth.getAccounts()    // gives you you the accounts for that seedphrase generated
        // 0x62C398D2208052c6c8452B97C181bCd01786cC89
    Note: you can only do the above two once you input the seedphrase and RPC url into the .env file. 
    This is because truffle-config.js uses the seedphrase and RPC url to "connect" to the blockchain with that wallet
    Think of it as using metamask through CLI
    hdwallet-provider is basically the wallet and we input our seedphrase in it to 'use' the wallet
5. Fund the wallet (send funds to it / get from faucets)
    await web3.eth.getBalance('0x62C398D2208052c6c8452B97C181bCd01786cC89') // to get the ETH balance OR
    await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0])
6. truffle migrate --network kovan --reset  // this deploys the contracts to network
Note: had to manually code the onlyOwner modifier. This was because of diff solidity versions for OpenZeppelin


7. We can also do tests (in the tests folder) and this tests will be done on a local blockchain (ganache). Hence,
deployment will be faster (no blocks need to be mined) and you instantly get test ETH e.g.
truffle test
